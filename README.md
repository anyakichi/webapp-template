# webapp-template

Web application template using Webpack5, ReScript, TypeScript, and React.

This template is for minimalists who think create-react-app is too
complex.

The sample program is written in ReScript and TypeScript for explanation,
but you can use only one of them.


## Production mode

```
$ yarn re:build
$ yarn build
```


## Development mode

```
$ yarn re:watch
$ yarn start
```
